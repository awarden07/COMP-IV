# PS7: Kronos Log Parsing

## Contact
Name: Adam Warden 
Section: 2
Time to Complete: 2 hours


## Description
This project has an original file that contains many lines of data. However, the only data of interest is whatever is defined by the regex expression. The regex expression is defined in the main method. The program will then parse through the file and find all the lines that match the regex expression. It will then print out the lines that match the regex expression.


### Features


### Approach
- file is read in
- regex expression is defined
- regex expression is used to find all lines that match the expression
- lines that match the expression are printed out

### Regex
-startSequence: starting condition for finding the start of the line
-successSequence: ending condition for finding the end of the line
### Issues

### Extra Credit
I outputed a summary header for each of the rpt files.
