### PS3: N-Body Simulation

## Contact

Section: 2
Time to Complete: 3 days

## Description
This project displays a scaled version of the solar system. It uses data extracted from planets.txt to determine the position and velocity of each planet. The program then uses this data to calculate the gravitational forces between each planet and update their positions and velocities accordingly. The program then displays the planets in their new positions.

## Features
CelestialBody class - This class stores the data for each planet. It contains the planet's name, mass, position, velocity, and radius. It also contains functions to calculate the gravitational force between two planets and to update the planet's position and velocity.

Test cases are implemented to ensure that the CelestialBody class is working properly.
## Memory
I used dynamic memory allocation to create an array of CelestialBody objects. This array is used to store the data for each planet. I also used dynamic memory allocation to create an array of sf::CircleShape objects. This array is used to display the planets.

## Issues
No current issues
