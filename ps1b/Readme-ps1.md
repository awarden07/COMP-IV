## Description
PhotoMagic is a program that takes a photo and applies a filter to it. The filter is determined by a string of 1's and 0's. The program will then apply the filter to the photo and output the new photo. The filter is determined by a FibLFSR. The FibLFSR is a linear feedback shift register that uses the Fibonacci sequence to determine the next bit in the sequence. The program will take the input string and convert it to an integer. The integer will then be used to determine the next bit in the sequence. The program will then take the next bit and convert it to a string. The string will then be used to determine the filter. The program will then apply the filter to the photo and output the new photo.
